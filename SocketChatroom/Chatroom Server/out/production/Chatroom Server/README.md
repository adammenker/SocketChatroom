PURPOSE:

The goal of this project is to create a chat room server that can listen for multiple clients requesting to connect and then handle the commands they write. The server will take in user input from the clients and allow each client to make a new user, login, send messages, see who is online, and logout. This is done using the Java socket API to allow clients to connect to this server and type commands.
